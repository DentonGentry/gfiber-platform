This is a draft for the ONT logs scraper, that will use
- textfsm 

host_connectivity_template is a template example for the 
oam host-connectivity-verify subscriber \"knssks757884610001\"' command.
It doesn't extract correctly the ipv6 addresses and prefixes.

Similar templates should be added for each command that should be ran on theONT.

The logExtractor.py contains is not currently functional.
